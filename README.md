# com_dinning_philosophers
## An Interactive Dinning Philosophers Animation Component For Joomla!
This is a simple Javascript animation that uses buttons to controll a step by step walkthrough of code, which uses semaphors.
If Joomla! is not an option, there is a standalone html file in media/js/ that allows a user to interact with the script.
